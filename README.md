## Event Listener Walkthrough
- There are three different event listeners for this game:
    1. The __Start__ listener randomly generates a question, removes/reveals content to/from the page, and begins the timer interval
    2. The __Answer Options__ listener reveals the submit button to the user
    3. The __Submit / Next Question__ listener toggles between two functions using a boolean value. One submits the answer, stops the timer, and removes the previous question from the array, and the other reveals the next question by randomly generating it from the array and displaying on the page.
